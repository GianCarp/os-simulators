# Documentation and Attribution

The virtual memory simulator and accompanying report in this directory
originated from a university Operating Systems assignment completed in a pair.
## Contributions

- **Gian-piero Carpinelli**  
  - Designed and implemented the virtual memory simulator in C  
  - Implemented LRU, CLOCK, and RAND page replacement policies (FIFO not required by assignment, later added)
  - Wrote the full academic report analysing simulator behaviour and results  

- **Project partner**  
  - Developed a Python script to automate running the simulator across
    different frame sizes  
  - Wrote R scripts to process output data and generate plots used in the report  

## Notes

After the assignment submission, the simulator was independently
refactored and extended beyond the original requirements. Subsequent
development in this repository reflects that ongoing work.
